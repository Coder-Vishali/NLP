Fantastic job. Clients are very happy with it. Congratulations!
I really liked the comment you made during yesterday team meeting. It was a great contribution to the discussion. Your positive attitude is felt throughout the department!
I wanted to let you know that I have noticed how much you have developed your python. I know it can be challenging to overcome or master python but we can feel your drive to succeed.
We have noticed how focused you are lately and how well you manage your time. You are producing tremendous work; keep it up!
We just wanted to congratulate you on hitting your first-year work anniversary! We are lucky to have had you on the team for the last 12 months.
I have noticed that you have been missing deadlines. It affects our overall productivity  and I believe that you can do better. To improve  let's work on setting more realistic schedules and sticking to them.
There are times when your work lacks attention to detail. To get better  I appreciate it if you could review your tasks more thoroughly for errors before you submit them
Your work quality seems to vary. I believe in your potential  and I like to see you aim for consistency by maintaining high standards in all tasks
I have noticed that you tend to wait for instructions rather than taking the initiative. To grow in your role  let's work on initiating tasks on your own and identifying areas that need attention
It appears that your time management needs some improvement. I believe you can do better by trying a time tracking system to meet deadlines more consistently.
You did a very worst job. I am completely disappointed.
